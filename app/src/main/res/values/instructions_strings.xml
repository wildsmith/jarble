            <p>The first step to using Jarble is to choose two target behaviors.
            <br>For example: following directions and marking good choices.</p>
            <p>Once the target behaviors are entered into the app, notes can be made about the chosen behaviors per interval.</p>
            <p>Each jar has ten marbles and in order to earn a reward at the end of two hours, eight marbles must be filled in.</p>
            <p>The intervals will run on two hour time periods and can be started at any time.</p>
            <p>The app will set a timer for you once you start an interval for the check-in periods.
            <br>The check-in timer will alert you every thirty minutes and at this time you will discuss how many marbles were earned (at each check-in two marbles can be earned).<p>
             <p>Rewards should be a pre-determined list and can only be available through achieving the required eight marbles.
             <br>Rewards that are available anytime may possibly be less effective when using this token system.</p>
